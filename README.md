# Creating a profile

In this tutorial, you will create an OpenProfile card and share it with friends. Let's get started!



1. First, go to [https://openprofile.is-cool.dev](https://openprofile.is-cool.dev). This is the web app that you will create your card in. It's online, so you don't need to download external software.
2. Pick a default avatar. As of writing, the options are:&#x20;

* 404: no avatar if no avatar is associated with the email provided.
* identicon: random geometric shapes if no avatar is associated with the email provided.
* retro: random retro-style image made out of squares and rectangles no avatar is associated with the email provided. looks like github's default avatar.
* mm: a human silhouette if no avatar is associated with the email provided.
* pagan: similar to identicon, but more human-like
* monsterid: creative 2d random monster if no avatar is associated with the email provided.
* robohash: similar to monsterid.

3. Fill out the details you want on the form. A name is required in all cases, and an email address is required if you want to use an avatar.
4. Click "Generate". It will generate a unique user ID for you.
5. After that, click "View Profile". It will redirect you to your card.
6. Congrats! You just created your very own OpenProfile card in 5 steps! Now you can copy the card URL and share it with your friends! [Here is an example :)](https://opr.ix.tc/sctech)
